  <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
  <p class="meta">End User License Agreement &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>
</header>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By downloading, installing, or using TapScore ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Agreement"). If you do not agree, do not use the App. These terms govern your use of the App made available to you by Steven Wang ("Developer").</p>

<h2>2. License Grant</h2>
<p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, the Developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the App on Apple-branded devices that you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes, as permitted by the Apple App Store Terms of Service.</p>
<p>You may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App or any portion of it</li>
  <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
  <li>Rent, lease, loan, sell, or sublicense the App</li>
  <li>Use the App for any commercial or public-performance purpose</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Pro Subscription – Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</h2>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <strong>Subscription Summary</strong>
  TapScore Pro is offered as an auto-renewable subscription with a 7-day free trial. After the trial, your subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
</div>

<p><strong>Available plans:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monthly Pro</strong> – Renews every month at the current App Store price</li>
  <li><strong>Yearly Pro</strong> – Renews every year at the current App Store price (best value)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> New subscribers receive a 7-day free trial. You will not be charged during the trial period. If you cancel before the trial ends, you will not be charged.</p>

<p><strong>Billing:</strong> Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase and at the start of each renewal period. Subscription prices are displayed in the App before purchase and are subject to change with notice.</p>

<p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings in the App Store. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you retain Pro access until that date. No refunds are provided for the unused portion of the current period.</p>

<p><strong>Renewal:</strong> Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Your Subscription:</strong> You can manage and cancel your subscription by going to your Account Settings in the App Store after purchase. For more information, visit: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Apple as Payment Processor</h2>
<p>All subscription purchases are processed by Apple Inc. through the App Store. Apple's standard payment terms apply. The Developer is the licensor of the App, and Apple is not a party to this Agreement except as set out in the Apple Developer Program License Agreement (Schedule 2). Apple has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services for the App.</p>
<p>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the Developer's sole responsibility.</p>

<h2>5. Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Please review our Privacy Policy at: <a href="https://tapscore.pages.dev/privacy">tapscore.pages.dev/privacy</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The App, including its source code, design, graphics, and all other elements, is owned by the Developer and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. Nothing in this Agreement transfers any intellectual property rights to you.</p>
<p>"TapScore" and its logo are trademarks of the Developer. You may not use these marks without prior written permission.</p>

<h2>7. User Content</h2>
<p>The App enables you to record and save video clips ("User Content") to your own device. You retain all rights to your User Content. The Developer does not upload, store, or process your User Content on external servers. All video data remains on your device and in your iCloud account if iCloud backup is enabled.</p>

<h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, EVEN IF THE DEVELOPER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES IS NOT PERMITTED, THE DEVELOPER'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Claims</h2>
<p>The Developer, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party have relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>

<h2>11. Intellectual Property Infringement Claims</h2>
<p>In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, the Developer, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Netherlands.</p>

<h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>The Developer may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the App or via email if you have provided one. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
