  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>
</header>

<div class="no-collect-box">
  <strong>Short version</strong>
  TapScore does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external server. All data — match scores, video clips, health metrics — stays on your device and your personal iCloud account. We have no backend, no analytics, and no advertising.
</div>

<h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
<p>TapScore ("the App") is developed and maintained by Steven Wang ("Developer", "we", "us"). The App is available on the Apple App Store for iPhone and Apple Watch. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tapscorepadel@gmail.com">tapscorepadel@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>The Developer is based in the Netherlands and this policy is written to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable Dutch law.</p>

<h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect, process, or store any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your name, email address, or any account information</li>
  <li>Device identifiers, IP addresses, or advertising IDs</li>
  <li>Usage analytics, crash reports sent to our servers, or behavioral data</li>
  <li>Location data</li>
  <li>Video or audio content — clips are saved only to your device</li>
  <li>Health data beyond what Apple Health stores on your device</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no TapScore account system. You do not sign in to use the App.</p>

<h2>3. Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
<p>The following data is created by your use of the App and stored only on your device (and in iCloud if you have iCloud backup enabled):</p>

<p><strong>Match History:</strong> Padel match scores, timestamps, set/game results, deuce mode, and serving information. Stored in your device's local storage and synced between your iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple's WatchConnectivity framework — which transfers data directly between your paired devices without passing through any external server.</p>

<p><strong>Video Clips (TapClip):</strong> Short video clips recorded during matches are saved to your iPhone's local storage (app Documents directory). These clips are never uploaded to our servers. If you share a clip, it is shared through standard iOS sharing mechanisms under your own control.</p>

<p><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences (clip duration, video quality, deuce mode, camera selection, watermark toggle) are stored locally using iOS UserDefaults and shared between iPhone and Watch via App Groups.</p>

<h2>4. Camera and Microphone</h2>
<p>TapScore's TapClip feature uses your iPhone's camera and microphone to record rolling-buffer video during a padel match. The App will request permission to access your camera and microphone before this feature can be used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may grant or deny these permissions at any time in iOS Settings → TapScore</li>
  <li>If you deny permission, the TapClip recording feature will not be available, but all other App features (match scoring, history) remain fully functional</li>
  <li>Camera and microphone access is used exclusively for local recording — no video or audio is transmitted anywhere</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Health and Fitness Data (Apple Watch)</h2>
<p>When you start a match on Apple Watch, TapScore optionally uses HealthKit to run a workout session that tracks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heart rate (read from Apple Watch sensors)</li>
  <li>Active energy burned (calories)</li>
  <li>Workout duration</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is written to Apple Health on your device and is governed entirely by Apple's HealthKit privacy policies. The Developer does not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to us. You can review, modify, or delete this data at any time in the Apple Health app.</p>

<h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
<p>TapScore Pro is an optional paid subscription processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not handle, see, or store any payment information (credit card numbers, billing addresses, etc.). All payment data is managed by Apple under their own privacy policy.</p>
<p>The only information we receive from Apple is a confirmation of your subscription status (active or inactive) via Apple's StoreKit framework — no personally identifiable information is included in this signal.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <strong>Apple's Privacy Policy</strong>
  For information about how Apple handles your payment data and App Store activity, see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.
</div>

<h2>7. iCloud Backup</h2>
<p>If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your iPhone, iOS may automatically back up the App's local data (match history, settings, video clips) to your personal iCloud account. This backup is encrypted and controlled entirely by Apple and your own iCloud settings. The Developer does not have access to your iCloud data.</p>
<p>To exclude TapScore from iCloud backup, go to iOS Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Account Storage → Backups → [your device] and disable TapScore.</p>

<h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>TapScore does not integrate any third-party analytics SDKs, advertising networks, crash reporting tools, or social media SDKs. The only third-party frameworks used are Apple system frameworks (StoreKit, HealthKit, WatchConnectivity, AVFoundation), all of which are governed by Apple's own privacy policies.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>TapScore is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the App collects no personal data at all, it is safe for use by people of all ages, but the subscription feature requires an Apple ID with parental controls or consent as required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>10. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect or process any personal data about you, most GDPR rights (access, erasure, portability, rectification) apply to data held locally on your device, which you control entirely. You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete match history</strong> within the App (swipe to delete in Match History)</li>
  <li><strong>Delete video clips</strong> within the App (Clips tab → select → delete)</li>
  <li><strong>Delete all App data</strong> by deleting TapScore from your device</li>
  <li><strong>Revoke permissions</strong> (camera, microphone, health) at any time in iOS Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe we hold any personal data about you and would like to exercise your rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tapscorepadel@gmail.com">tapscorepadel@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within 30 days.</p>

<h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
<p>All data stays on your device for as long as the App is installed. When you delete the App, all locally stored data (match history, clips, settings) is permanently deleted from your device. Video clips can also be deleted individually at any time within the App.</p>

<h2>12. Security</h2>
<p>Since no personal data is transmitted to or stored on external servers, the primary security perimeter is your device itself. TapScore relies on iOS's built-in security model (device encryption, App Sandbox, secure iCloud backup). We recommend keeping your device and iOS up to date to benefit from Apple's security improvements.</p>

<h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page and may communicate changes through an App Store update notice. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>14. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
